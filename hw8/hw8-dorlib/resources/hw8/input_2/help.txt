I need somebody
( Help ) not just anybody
( Help ) you know I need someone, help
So much younger than today
( I never need ) I never needed anybody's help in any way
( Now ) but now these days are gone ( these days are gone )
I'm not so self assured
( And now I find ) now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
In oh so many ways
( My independ- ) my independence seems to vanish in the haze
( But ) but every now and then ( now and then )
I feel so insecure
( I know that I ) I know that I just need you like
I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
( Now ) but now these days are gone ( these days are gone )
I'm not so self assured
( And now I find ) now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, ooh
